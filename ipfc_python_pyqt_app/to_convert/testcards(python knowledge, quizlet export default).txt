member variables	variables only available to members of certain class
instance variable	variable only available to one instance of a class
=	assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
sys	module - contains important objects and functions
os	module - OS routines for NT or POSIX
seek()	move to a new position in file, reads bytes
variable	a name for a place to store strings, numbers etc.
from .... import ....	imports specific attributes from a module
module	a file containing Python definitions, statements or scripts, can be user defined or from a built-in library
#	Octothorpe

placing a # at the beginning of a line or in the middle of a line tells python to ignore whatever is written on the line after the #
PEMDAS	Order of Operations:
Mode of Operations:
Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction
Floating Point Number	any number with a decimal point showing one or more digits behind the decimal point.
e. "4.0" or "0.087"
%	Modulus
is NOT used as a "percentage" sign in the programming language
%d, %i	Signed integer decimal
%o	Signed octal value
%x	Signed hexidecimal
%e	Floating point exponential format
%c	Single character
''',"""	Free-form strings
"	Every time you put " (double-quotes) around a piece of text you have been making a string. A string is how you make something that your program might give to a human. You print strings, save strings to files, send strings to web servers, and many other things.
' (single-quotes) also work for this purpose.
"""	Use to make a string that needs multiple lines for the string text.
variables	can only start with a character (not a number)
%d	digit
Write comments on code ...	No, you write comments only to explain difficult to understand code or why you did something. Why is usually much more important, and then you try to write the code so that it explains how something is being done on its own. However, sometimes you have to write such nasty code to solve a problem that it does need a comment on every line. In this case it's strictly for you to practice translating code to English.
True
False	Python recognizes True and False as keywords representing the concept of true and false. If you put quotes around them then they are turned into strings and won't work.
%f	float

Floating point decimal format
\uxxxx	Character with 16-bit hex value xxxx (Unicode only)
\ooo	Character with octal value ooo
\Uxxxxxxxx	Character with 32-bit hex value xxxxxxxx (Unicode only)
How do I get a number from someone so I can do math?	That's a little advanced, but try x = int(raw_input()) which gets the number as a string from raw_input() then converts it to an integer using int()
,	We put a , (comma) at the end of each print line. This is so print doesn't end the line with a newline character and go to the next line
\xhh	Character with hex value hh
from sys import argv	Called an "import."

This is how you add features to your script from the Python feature set. Rather than give you all the features at once, Python asks you to say what you plan to use. This keeps your programs small, but it also acts as documentation for other programmers who read your code later.

May access features other than "argv"
argv	the "argument variable," a very standard name in programming, that you will find used in many other languages. This variable holds the arguments you pass to your Python script when you run it.

You know how you type python ex13.py to run the ex13.py file? Well the ex13.py part of the command is called an "argument." What we'll do now is write a script that also accepts arguments.

What's the difference between argv and raw_input()?
The difference has to do with where the user is required to give input. If they give your script inputs on the command line, then you use argv. If you want them to input using the keyboard while the script is running, then use raw_input().

Line 3:
script, first, second, third = argv
Line 3 "unpacks" argv so that, rather than holding all the arguments, it gets assigned to four variables you can work with: script, first, second, and third. This may look strange, but "unpack" is probably the best word to describe what it does. It just says, "Take whatever is in argv, unpack it, and assign it to all of these variables on the left in order." (ex13.py)
strings	A string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone, or "export" out of the program you are writing. Python knows you want something to be a string when you put either " (double-quotes) or ' (single-quotes) around the text. You saw this many times with your use of print when you put the text you want to go inside the string inside " or ' after the print to print the string.

Strings may contain the format characters you have discovered so far. You simply put the formatted variables in the string, and then a % (percent) character, followed by the variable. The only catch is that if you want multiple formats in your string to print multiple variables, you need to put them inside ( ) (parenthesis) separated by , (commas). It's as if you were telling me to buy you a list of items from the store and you said, "I want milk, eggs, bread, and soup." Only as a programmer we say, "(milk, eggs, bread, soup)."
import	This is how you add features to your script from the Python feature set. Rather than give you all the features at once, Python asks you to say what you plan to use. This keeps your programs small, but it also acts as documentation for other programmers who read your code later.

Where "Enter_Something" is what the prompt is, asking you to enter some text, and var is where the text is stored

Remember the %r in the prompt
